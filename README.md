# Znake - The Game
🐍
Welcome to Znake - The Game. A classic game brought to life with Python and best practices.

## This Repo
🛠️
While the game itself is a fun demo, this repository also showcases some important developer practices and principles. Here’s what I’ve included:

- Version Control: Clean commit history with PRs raised into the main branch.

- Unit Testing: Comprehensive unit tests to ensure everything works smoothly.

- Linter: Integrated code quality checks to keep the code clean and readable.

- CI/CD Pipeline: Automated Continuous Integration and Deployment workflows for seamless development.

Not only does this repo showcase solid software development principles, but there’s also a playable Znake game here to enjoy. 🎮

## Setting Up the Project Locally
⚙
If you want to run the game locally, simply run the python executable found within the latest released version of the game.
It currently only works on Windows machines, as that's all I had to test with!
