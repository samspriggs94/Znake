Snake - The Game

# This repo
While not the most technically impressive repository, this is a small demo of good developer principles and practises.
I have:
- Raised PRs into the main branch, and have a clean commit history.
- Added unit tests.
- Added a linter and CI pipeline.
- Added a deployment workflow.

On top of this, there is a playable game of snake.
Please enjoy :)
